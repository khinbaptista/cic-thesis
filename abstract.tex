Learning shader programming often requires the novice to create an entire host
application, having to manually load polygonal models and textures, and to deal
with graphics API details. This process can be quite discouraging, deviating
one's attention from actual shader programming  to the development of
application infrastructure. To alleviate this load, shader development
environments have been created by GPU manufacturers, such as NVidia's FX
Composer  and AMD's RenderMonkey, but both have long been discontinued, not
supporting modern shading languages. Available  on-line resources, like
Shadertoy and Shdr,  can be valuable tools in assisting the learning of shader
programming, but are often difficult to use, have limited feature sets, and/or
lack proper documentation to get beginners  started. We present a complete
environment for learning and exploring shader programming using GLSL. Our
environment, developed using Vulkan, can suit the needs of  both beginners and
advanced users. Its user-friendly interface allows one to effortlessly load 3D
models and images and modify variables and textures, applying the changes in
real time.
