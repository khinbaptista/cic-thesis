In order to learn shader programming, students often have to create the entire
host application to manually load 3-dimensional meshes and images, and deal
with specific graphic API details. This process can easily distract the
student, deviating attention from the actual shader programming. There are
tools to assist these tasks, such as NVidia's FX Composer - which has been
discontinued since 2008 - and some online resources, like Shadertoy and Shdr,
but those are often difficult to use, have a limited feature set, and/or lack
documentation to get beginners started.

In this work we built an easy-to-use desktop tool which provides the full
environment required for shader programming from beginner to advanced, with a
user-friendly interface which allows students to effortlessly load 3D models
and images and modify variables and textures while the program is running,
applying the changes in real time.
