\chapter{Introduction}
Computer graphics is an important subject in any computer science degree. It is a very useful tool for many other areas, such as artificial intelligence, robotics and simulations, as well as for the industry, most notably cinema and the video games industry.

Such an important subject, however, may easily overwhelm novices, requiring them to understand so much of the theoretical concepts before even having the first contact with practical computer graphics and the results that can be achieved.

Using Vulkan, a modern graphics API, we have built an application that provides a complete environment for shader programming. With this tool, students will be able to write shaders without having to worry about the graphics pipeline as a whole, getting results more quickly, and will hopefully grow more interested in computer graphics.

% CG is important, vast area of knowledge
% Good visual feedback by nature, can be used to teach other subjects (physics?)
% important for simulations
% Difficult to debug
