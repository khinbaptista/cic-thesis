\chapter{Introduction}

Shader programming is an essential part of modern computer graphics. However, in order to write her/his first shader program, one is often faced with the need to write an entire host application that will supply data for the shader. This includes establishing associations between variables from the host program and from the shader, loading polygonal models, setting parameters, initializing textures, etc.  
All this can be quite discouraging for a novice, deviating one's attention from actual shader programming to the development of application infrastructure.

%%Computer graphics is an important subject in any computer science degree. It is a very useful tool for many other areas, such as artificial intelligence, robotics and simulations, as well as for the industry, most notably cinema and video games.

%%Such an important subject, however, may easily overwhelm novices, requiring them to understand so much of the theoretical concepts before even having the first contact with practical computer graphics and the results that can be achieved.

To make it easier for newcomers, we have built an application that provides a complete environment for shader programming. With this tool, one will be able to write shaders without having to worry about such infrastructure details. By being able to focus on the shaders themselves and get results faster, we hope to encourage more students to learn computer graphics.
Developing such a tool also had another important personal goal: serve as an opportunity for learning Vulkan, a modern graphics API.
