\section{Shading languages}
Programming languages designed for computer graphics, which are used to define shaders, implementing an illumination model. Various shading languages exist:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CG: \emph{C for Graphics}, developed by NVidia in collaboration with Microsoft, it has been deprecated since 2012;
    \item HLSL: \emph{High-Level Shader Language}, used with DirectX 9 and higher;
    \item GLSL: \emph{OpenGL Shading Language}, used with OpenGL.
\end{itemize}

In this work, all the shader code was written in GLSL. We will not be covering the GLSL language specifics; there are entire books about it, and it goes beyond the scope of this text.
