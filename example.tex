\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{figs/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{../figs/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath
\usepackage{amsthm}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
In order to learn shader programming, students often have to create the entire
host application to manually load 3-dimensional meshes and images, and deal
with specific graphic API details. This process can easily distract the
student, deviating attention from the actual shader programming. There are
tools to assist these tasks, such as NVidia's FX Composer - which has been
discontinued since 2008 - and some online resources, like Shadertoy and Shdr,
but those are often difficult to use, have a limited feature set, and/or lack
documentation to get beginners started.

In this work we built an easy-to-use desktop tool which provides the full
environment required for shader programming from beginner to advanced, with a
user-friendly interface which allows students to effortlessly load 3D models
and images and modify variables and textures while the program is running,
applying the changes in real time.

\section{Introduction}
SIBGRAPI 2018 \cite{SIBGRAPI2018}.

\subsection{Subsection Heading Here}
Subsection text here.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading Here}
Subsubsection text here.

\section{Architecture}
In this work, the most important decision of the architecture was the choice of
using Vulkan for the graphics API. Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D
graphics and compute API created by the Khronos Group. Using Vulkan has been a
learning process, and the architecture chosen for this work is a reflection of
that learning process.

For the purposes of this work, a Material is defined as a combination of a
vertex shader and a fragment shader, along with their uniforms values. A Shader
is the created from the source GLSL code provided by the user, which is then
compiled into SPIR-V binary code and stored. In order to be able to preview the
material, a Geometry object can be created: a geometri is a combination of
vertex attributes (vertex position, normal, tangent and texture coordinates)
which will be passed to the graphics pipeline.

\subsection{Shader Module}
A Shader object represents one stage of the programmable pipeline stages.
In this work, it has a type, which indicate whether the shader is a vertex or a
fragment shader. The type of the shader is inferred when a GLSL shader file is
loaded based on the extension of the shader file, '.vert' for a vertex shader
and '.frag' for a fragment shader.

The module is also capable of compiling the GLSL source code into SPIR-V, an
intermediate binary file format. The compilation is done using a third-party
library, libshaderc, developed by Google. The SPIR-V code is then used to create
the Vulkan shader module, an object used in the pipeline creation later.

Shaders can define uniform objects containing various uniforms. The uniforms
names are checked for specific names and, if their types match, their values are
loaded automatically. This applies, for example, to a uniform of type "mat4"
named "modelViewProjection". A similar process is adopted for vertex attributes,
where their names and types are checked in order to load the correct values in
the vertex buffer later on.

Possible uniform names updated automatically are: "model", "view", "projection",
"modelView", "modelViewProjection", their inverse counterparts with "Inverse" as
suffix, "cameraMatrix" (which is the view and projection transformations
combined) and "normalMatrix" (the inverse transposed 3x3 modelView submatrix).
All the matrices must be of type "mat4", except the normal matrix, which must be
a "mat3" matrix.

Possible vertex attributes are: "position", "normal", "tangent" and "uv"
(texture coordinates). The first three attributes may be either of type "vec3"
or "vec4". Position vectors with four components will have W component equal to
one; Normal vectors will have a W component equal to zero; Tangent vectors will
have either 1 or -1 for its fourth component, indicating which side the binormal
vector points to. Texture coordinates must be of type "vec2".

Shaders can also define image samplers of type "sampler2D" and "samplerCube" in
GLSL. These will be initialized in the material module with a default texture
until the user selects a new one using the user interface.

Uniforms objects and samplers must have different binding decoration numbers
specified in GLSL using the layout qualifier.

\subsection{Material Module}
A Material is a combination of a vertex and a fragment shader, plus the values
of the uniform variables defined in those shaders.

The material module is responsible for parsing the shaders' SPIR-V codes and
check uniform names. The code analysis is done using a third-party library,
SPIRV-Cross, a tool and library for performing reflection on SPIR-V and
disassembling SPIR-V back to high level languages. After the analysis, a
description of the requested uniform data is created in order to allow the
creation of the uniform buffer object later on. It also parses the image
samplers and the attributes requested by the shader code.

The material module also deals with many aspects of the Vulkan API, like
creating a descriptor pool, a descriptor set layout, a pipeline layout and
a pipeline object.

\subsection{Geometry Module}
Every geometry object has standard transformation parameters (translation,
rotation and scale), and an assigned material.

When a material is assigned, the parsed vertex attributes in the material are
used to create a vertex buffer object, an index buffer object (only if the
geometry has vertex indices data). The parsed uniform data description in the
material is also used by the geometry module to create a uniform buffer object.

This module also deals with Vulkan directly, allocating a descriptor set from
the assigned material's descriptor pool and recording drawing commands in
command buffers.

\subsection{Texture Module}
The texture module deals with Vulkan in order to pass image data for the
shaders. This means creating Vulkan objects for an image, image view and
sampler.

Images are loaded by Godot Engine, the engine used to create the user interface.

\subsection{Camera Module}
A simple module to model a virtual camera. It has a position, target and up
vector for reference and an angle for the field of view of the projection.




% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.

\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

\label{fig_second_case}}
\caption{SIBGRAPI - Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images.}
\label{fig_sim2}
\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
\begin{table}[]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
