\section{Future Work}
The work presented here is a proof of concept and, as such, some desirable features may be missing. For example, in a real learning scenario, the user should be able to reload updated source files to shaders, which is currently not implemented. It would also be intersting to have a project file format, so users can save the projects to continue working later, or share the scene with other students or the teacher. It is also possible to implement a GLSL text editor so the user can write shaders without using an external editor.

Other desirable features currently missing are loading custom geometry files instead of a predefined set of geometric primitives, and cubemap sampler support.

The overall implementation could also benefit from more rigid software engineering guidelines in order to separete the core functionality to the interface used to communicate with the user interface (using the model-view-controller model, for example).
