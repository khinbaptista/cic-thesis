\section{Architecture}
In this work, the most important decision of the architecture was the choice of
using Vulkan for the graphics API. Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D
graphics and compute API created by the Khronos Group. Using Vulkan has been a
learning process, and the architecture chosen for this work is a reflection of
that learning process.

For the purposes of this work, a Material is defined as a combination of a
vertex shader and a fragment shader, along with their uniforms values. A Shader
is the created from the source GLSL code provided by the user, which is then
compiled into SPIR-V binary code and stored. In order to be able to preview the
material, a Geometry object can be created: a geometri is a combination of
vertex attributes (vertex position, normal, tangent and texture coordinates)
which will be passed to the graphics pipeline.
