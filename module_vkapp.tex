\subsection{Vulkan Application Module}
Vulkan is a low-level API and, as such, requires developers to setup a large amount of objects and configurations before displaying anything on screen. This module is responsible for creating the Vulkan instance, selecting a physical device (usually a GPU), enabling extensions and features on the device, creating a logical device to perform commands, setting up debug layers for development builds, and other various tasks required by Vulkan in order to work properly. It also handles the Vulkan display window, created via a third-party library, GLFW, and window input (such as those for camera movement).
