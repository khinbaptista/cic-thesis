\subsection{Vulkan Application Module}
Vulkan is a low-level API and, as such, requires developers to setup a large amount of objects and configuration values before displaying anything on screen. This module is responsible for creating the Vulkan instance, selecting a physical device (usually a GPU), enabling extensions and features on the device, creating a logical device to execute the application, setting up debug layers for development builds, and other various tasks required by Vulkan in order to work properly. It also handles the Vulkan display window, created with a third-party library, GLFW, and window input (for camera movement, for example).
