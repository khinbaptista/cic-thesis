\subsection{Camera Module}
A simple module to model a virtual camera. It has a position, target and up vectors for reference and an angle for the field of view of the projection.

This module provides the view and projection matrices used to transform the objects in the shaders. It also presents methods for moving and turning, used by the Vulkan application module.
