\section{Conclusion}
Creating this application has been a wonderful learning exercise of the Vulkan API, and the efforts have resulted in a very interesting piece of software with a real-world use-case scenario, with lots of room to grow. Given the proper treatment, this application, which currently is presented as a proof of concept, could be really useful in classes, from fundamentals of computer graphics to advanced shader programming.
