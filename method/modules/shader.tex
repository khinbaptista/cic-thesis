\subsection{Shader Module}
A shader object represents one stage of the programmable pipeline stages. This module has a type indication, either vertex or fragment, and is capable of loading GLSL source files and compiling them into SPIR-V binary using the ShaderC library, developed by Google \cite{shaderc_repo}. The compiled code is then enclosed by a `VkShaderModule' object which will be used in a material's graphics pipeline. The type of the shader is inferred when a GLSL shader file is loaded based on the extension of the shader file, `.vert' for a vertex shader and `.frag' for a fragment shader. This module also provides ways to check the compilation status and get any compilation error messages.
